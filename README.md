### Rough Draft Project Outline

    Code Input: Allow users to input their JavaScript code snippets using the interactive code editor.

    Framework Selection: Provide a dropdown or radio buttons where users can select the framework they want to translate the code to (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte).

    Translation Output: Based on the selected framework, display the translated code snippet in the chosen framework. You would need to have pre-defined translation patterns for each framework.

    Step-by-Step Explanation: Include a section that explains the translated code snippet in the chosen framework. Highlight the key differences and features of each framework.

    Interactive Learning: Include interactive elements such as toggling between the original and translated code, highlighting the changes, and providing real-time feedback as users modify the code.
